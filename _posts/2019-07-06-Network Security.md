# [](#header-1)개요
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that detects network or system intrusions. One analogy that comes to mind is a guard watching live feeds from different security cameras. He can spot a theft, but he cannot stop it by himself. However, if this guard can contact another guard and ask them to stop the robber, detection turns into prevention. An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) or simply Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a system that can detect and prevent intrusions.

Understanding the difference between detection and prevention is essential. Snort is a network intrusion detection and intrusion detection system. Consequently, Snort can be set up as an IDS or an IPS. For Snort to function as an IPS, it needs some mechanism to block (drop) offending connections. This capability requires Snort to be set up as inline and to bridge two or more network cards.

As a signature-based network IDS, Snort is shown in the figure below.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
